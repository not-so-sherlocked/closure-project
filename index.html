                    <div class="letter-content">
                        <p>There's no clue who is writing this, and I truly wish for this to stay anonymous. I'm just… <span class="highlight">a nobody</span>. A silent person who saw you once and never forgot.</p>
                        <p>I first saw you when we were in 8th grade. Back then, my world was quiet — almost like I lived in a space only I knew. And then, you entered that world, unknowingly breaking the silence I had wrapped myself in.</p>
                        <p>I was never the talkative type. I barely spoke to anyone — just watched people from afar, too shy to ever step closer. I've always been an introvert, someone who finds it hard to talk, even harder to express.</p>
                        <p>And one day, a long time later, you smiled at me for no reason — while I was walking with my friend. I took it as a casual smile. But he didn't. He sparked a thought of you in my mind that never really faded.</p>
                        <p>For the past six years, I've quietly carried that flicker. Somewhere in between, I got a beautiful opportunity to connect with you — a rare, unexpected moment, like a thread the universe dropped between us. But as always, I stayed silent. Not because I didn't want to talk, but because I didn't know how to. And I guess, neither did you.</p>
                        <p>You probably don't remember me. You probably never even noticed me. That's okay.</p>
                        <p>Still, I know a lot about you — not in a creepy way, but out of curiosity, admiration. I followed your journey from a distance. I watched your stories. I saw your smile again.</p>
                        <p>And though I found ways to know more about you, I had chances to say hi. I didn't. Not because I feared rejection. But because I feared breaking whatever fragile, imagined version of you I carried in my mind. And maybe a little because of my ego. Or fear of being just another forgettable face.</p>
                        <p>I know how this sounds — strange, maybe even unsettling. But I promise, this isn't some twisted love letter. It's more like… <span class="highlight">closure</span>. For me.</p>
                        <p>Because after six years, I want to stop thinking about what <span class="highlight">could've been</span> — and start making peace with what <span class="highlight">wasn't</span>.</p>
                        <p>That's why I'm writing this. To stop. To move on.</p>
                        <p>But before that, I needed to tell you this — not because I expect a reply, not because I want you to feel something, but because this is the only way I can free myself.</p>
                        <p>And maybe, just maybe — if you ever read this, and if any word even slightly touches you, drop a reply — even just a "" — just to let me feel like I made a tiny ripple in your world.</p>
                        <p>All I ever wanted was to send this thought out into the universe. I honestly don't know where I found the courage to send this. Maybe it's madness. Maybe it's healing. Or maybe it's just time.</p>
                        <p>This isn't a confession. This isn't a proposal. This is just a quiet goodbye to a story that never began — but lived in someone's heart for far too long.</p>
                        <p>Wishing you peace, freedom, and everything beautiful you deserve. And thank you — for unknowingly being part of someone's universe. Someone you may never remember, but who'll always remember you.</p>

                    <div class="letter-content">
                        <p>Last Sunday, I sent you the letter.</p>
                        <p>I called the entire process the <span class="highlight-heading">Closure Project</span> — because that was its only purpose: to let you know how I felt and make a tiny ripple in your world before closing a long chapter of my life.</p>
                        <p>And yes, the project was successfully completed.
                        I finally closed that chapter with peace.
                        What I didn’t expect was the kind of response you gave — calm, kind, and graceful. I’m truly grateful for that. I never imagined a girl would handle it that way.</p>
                                                <p>                            I know you probably don’t remember me, and that’s okay. I never expected you to.
                           In my mind, I always thought you were different — not just another random person. For a while, I thought that was just my imagination. But now, after this, I know you really are a 10/10 — even though our conversations were brief and limited. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Since the Closure Project, I’ve been feeling a sense of peace I hadn’t felt in years.
                            My thoughts are clearer. My goals feel brighter. I’ve been more motivated and productive every single day.
                            As I once said — you were a flicker in my thoughts.
                            Now, that flicker has become a stone — a rare, precious one that I’ll keep as an ideal until I meet something that feels like that again.
                                                    </p>
                        <p>
                            Even though I told you goodbye forever and truly moved on, I’ll admit — there’s still a little room left that hopes for you.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If someday you feel anything for me — anything real — all you need to do is knock.
                            Until I find someone who feels like you, I’ll quietly hold that door open.

                            Once again, thank you for being part of my story — unknowingly.
                            Wishing you all the luck, love, and success in your life.
                        </p>
