                    <div class="letter-content">
                        <p>There's no clue who is writing this, and I truly wish for this to stay anonymous. I'm just… <span class="highlight">a nobody</span>. A silent person who saw you once and never forgot.</p>
                        <p>I first saw you when we were in 8th grade. Back then, my world was quiet — almost like I lived in a space only I knew. And then, you entered that world, unknowingly breaking the silence I had wrapped myself in.</p>
                        <p>I was never the talkative type. I barely spoke to anyone — just watched people from afar, too shy to ever step closer. I've always been an introvert, someone who finds it hard to talk, even harder to express.</p>
                        <p>And one day, a long time later, you smiled at me for no reason — while I was walking with my friend. I took it as a casual smile. But he didn't. He sparked a thought of you in my mind that never really faded.</p>
                        <p>For the past six years, I've quietly carried that flicker. Somewhere in between, I got a beautiful opportunity to connect with you — a rare, unexpected moment, like a thread the universe dropped between us. But as always, I stayed silent. Not because I didn't want to talk, but because I didn't know how to. And I guess, neither did you.</p>
                        <p>You probably don't remember me. You probably never even noticed me. That's okay.</p>
                        <p>Still, I know a lot about you — not in a creepy way, but out of curiosity, admiration. I followed your journey from a distance. I watched your stories. I saw your smile again.</p>
                        <p>And though I found ways to know more about you, I had chances to say hi. I didn't. Not because I feared rejection. But because I feared breaking whatever fragile, imagined version of you I carried in my mind. And maybe a little because of my ego. Or fear of being just another forgettable face.</p>
                        <p>I know how this sounds — strange, maybe even unsettling. But I promise, this isn't some twisted love letter. It's more like… <span class="highlight">closure</span>. For me.</p>
                        <p>Because after six years, I want to stop thinking about what <span class="highlight">could've been</span> — and start making peace with what <span class="highlight">wasn't</span>.</p>
                        <p>That's why I'm writing this. To stop. To move on.</p>
                        <p>But before that, I needed to tell you this — not because I expect a reply, not because I want you to feel something, but because this is the only way I can free myself.</p>
                        <p>And maybe, just maybe — if you ever read this, and if any word even slightly touches you, drop a reply — even just a "" — just to let me feel like I made a tiny ripple in your world.</p>
                        <p>All I ever wanted was to send this thought out into the universe. I honestly don't know where I found the courage to send this. Maybe it's madness. Maybe it's healing. Or maybe it's just time.</p>
                        <p>This isn't a confession. This isn't a proposal. This is just a quiet goodbye to a story that never began — but lived in someone's heart for far too long.</p>
                        <p>Wishing you peace, freedom, and everything beautiful you deserve. And thank you — for unknowingly being part of someone's universe. Someone you may never remember, but who'll always remember you.</p>
